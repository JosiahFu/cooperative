# Cooperative
### Overview
Cooperative is a FabricMC mod which makes players spawn close to other online players whenever possible.

This allows for bases to be made far from world spawn, without new players having to trek all the way over.

### Implementation
Cooperative finds the player closest to your spawn point, and teleports you near or directly to them depending on how dangerous the spawn location is.

### Additional Information
The mod must be installed on the server. Client installation is optional.

This mod is for Fabric only, though the license allows for anyone to make a Forge port if they wish.
